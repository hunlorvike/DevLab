## ðŸ¤¬ Fucking Algorithm ðŸ¤¬

This project is dedicated to exploring the fascinating and sometimes frustrating world of algorithms!

### System Requirements

- **Python 3.7 or higher:** Ensure you have a recent version of Python installed.
- **Pip:** The Python package manager is used to install project dependencies.

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Clone the Project:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/fucking-algorithm.git
   cd fucking-algorithm
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
   Using a virtual environment isolates your project's dependencies.

   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Packages:**
   If your project has a `requirements.txt` file, you can easily install all necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Get ready to dive into the world of algorithms!** ðŸš€
